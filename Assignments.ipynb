They spend time in meetings, gathering requirements, documenting processes, and recommending solutions that might not even involve data sometimes. Think process improvement, stakeholder management, and strategic planning.\n",

Their job is to find patterns, trends, and insights buried in numbers. They're more technical with SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization tools. Less meetings, more spreadsheets. Business Analysts look at the bigger organizational picture and work on improving processes and systems. Data Analysts dive deep into datasets to extract meaningful insights that support decisions.\n",
